# Spring Cloud Gateway MVC (fn) to Postman Echo service

- A simple Spring Cloud Gateway application that routes requests to the Postman Echo service. It automatically appends
  the `method` of the request to the Postman Echo URL `https://postman-echo.com/{method}`.

- Supports per request timeout by using  `X-TIMEOUT-MILLIS` header. If the header is not present, the default timeout is used.
- Converts `SocketTimeoutException` or `HttpConnectTimeoutException` into `HttpStatus.GATEWAY_TIMEOUT` response.
- Sets a request header `x-method`
- Sets a response header `x-method`

Use [Test page](http://localhost:8080/test.html) to test the application.
